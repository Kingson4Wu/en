	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>
		Hi, I'm Kingson Wu, a senior software engineer with extensive experience in distributed systems,
		large language models, and modern software architecture. This blog shares my technical insights,
		research findings, and practical experiences in the ever-evolving field of software development.
	</p>

	<h3>Technical Focus</h3>
	<p>
		My expertise spans several key areas in modern software development:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI systems</li>
		<li>Distributed systems and microservices architecture</li>
		<li>Network protocols and infrastructure</li>
		<li>Programming methodologies and best practices</li>
		<li>Generative AI applications and multimodal systems</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Writing Philosophy</h3>
	<p>
		I believe in deep technical analysis combined with practical implementation. Each article aims to bridge the gap
		between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. I often explore complex topics like function calling
		in LLMs, RPC systems, distributed transactions, and the latest developments in AI and machine learning.
	</p>

	<h3>Transparency</h3>
	<p>
		Many of my posts incorporate assistance from AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude, which I openly acknowledge
		in each article to maintain transparency about the collaborative nature of modern content creation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Welcome to my technical journey. Feel free to explore the articles and reach out if you have questions or suggestions.
